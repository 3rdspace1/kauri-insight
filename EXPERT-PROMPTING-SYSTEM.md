## 💚❤️💙 Sentiment-Based Visual Strategies

Research shows specific visual elements trigger emotional responses. Our system uses psychological principles:

### Positive Sentiment

**Visual Strategy**:
- **Color Psychology**: Vibrant greens (growth), energetic blues (trust), optimistic yellows (happiness)
- **Composition**: Upward trajectories, expanding forms, open spaces, ascending diagonals
- **Lighting**: Bright, warm, front-lit, radiating luminosity
- **Shapes**: Rounded corners, flowing curves, organic forms, expanding circles
- **Energy**: Dynamic movement, forward momentum, celebratory patterns
- **Depth**: Expansive perspective, open horizons, unlimited potential
- **Texture**: Smooth, polished, crystalline clarity, radiant gradients

**Why It Works**: Upward movement and warm colors trigger positive emotional responses. Open spaces suggest growth and possibility.

### Neutral Sentiment

**Visual Strategy**:
- **Color Psychology**: Balanced blues (stability), professional grays (objectivity), measured teals (clarity)
- **Composition**: Centered balance, symmetric arrangements, equilibrium points, horizontal stability
- **Lighting**: Even, diffused, balanced shadows, neutral temperature
- **Shapes**: Geometric precision, structured forms, balanced proportions, clear lines
- **Energy**: Steady flow, measured pace, consistent rhythm
- **Depth**: Controlled perspective, organized layers, methodical depth
- **Texture**: Matte finishes, uniform surfaces, professional polish

**Why It Works**: Symmetry and balance signal objectivity. Neutral colors avoid emotional bias while maintaining professionalism.

### Negative Sentiment (Attention-Requiring)

**Visual Strategy**:
- **Color Psychology**: Alerting oranges (urgency), critical reds (attention), cautionary yellows (warning)
- **Composition**: Attention-grabbing focal points, diagonal tensions, concentrated areas, urgent asymmetry
- **Lighting**: Focused spotlighting, dramatic contrasts, shadow emphasis
- **Shapes**: Sharp angles, pointed markers, angular warnings, concentrated areas
- **Energy**: Contained intensity, focused urgency, directed attention
- **Depth**: Compressed perspective, near-field focus, immediate presence
- **Texture**: Tactile urgency, dimensional emphasis, alert gradients

**Why It Works**: Angular forms and warm/hot colors naturally draw attention. Asymmetry creates tension that demands action.

### Human Elements
**Avoid**: people, faces, hands, human figures, portraits
**Reason**: Unnecessary for data visualization, can distract

### Logo Confusion
**Avoid**: logos, trademarks, watermarks, signatures
**Reason**: Handled separately through proper channels

### Quality Issues
**Avoid**: blurry, pixelated, compression, grainy, noisy, distorted
**Reason**: Undermines professional presentation

### Inappropriate Styles
**Avoid**: cartoon, anime, sketch, amateur, unprofessional, childish
**Reason**: Not suitable for business intelligence
