## 🔧 **If Deployment Fails:**

### **Check Build Logs:**

   - Playwright not installing → Should work with postinstall script
   - TypeScript errors → Unlikely (build passed locally)

### **Quick Fix:**
If build fails, try:
1. Go to Vercel → Deployments
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"** button
4. Wait for rebuild

## ✅ **Success Checklist:**

- [ ] https://www.kauriinsight.com loads
- [ ] Can sign in with email
- [ ] Settings → Business page exists

## 🎯 **Expected Timeline:**

- **Now**: Vercel is building (started automatically)
- **+3 minutes**: Build completes
- **+5 minutes**: Deployment ready
- **+6 minutes**: DNS propagates (if needed)
- **+7 minutes**: **LIVE!** 🚀

---

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

### **Playwright (PDF Export):**
- Vercel has Playwright support built-in
- Your `postinstall` script handles installation
- If PDFs fail: Check Vercel function logs
- May need to increase timeout in Vercel settings

### **ModelsLab (AI Visuals):**
- With API key: Gets 4K generated covers ✅
- Without API key: Uses beautiful SVG placeholders ✅
- Both work perfectly!

### **Database:**
- Already migrated on Railway ✅
- Connection string in env vars ✅
- Ready to use!
